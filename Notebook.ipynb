One popular solution to this problem is to employ *K-fold cross-validation*. Here, the original training data is split into `K non-overlapping` subsets. Then model training and validation are executed $K$ times, each time training on $K-1$ subsets and validating on a different subset (the one not used for training in that round). Finally, the training and validation error rates are estimated by averaging overthe results from the $K$ experiments.\n",

We first need a function that returns the `i-th` fold of the data in a `k-fold` cross-validation procedure.

Note that this is not the most efficient way of handling data and we would definitely do something much smarter if our dataset was considerably larger.
